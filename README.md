# Cloud-based-BMS-data-analytics-using-IoT
Here we are sensing voltages, current, and temperature of Battery and uploading to thingspeak to analyze that data. 


This project consist of two microcontroller board one is arduino uno for collecting all data from sensors and another is Node MCU whichh is used for internet connectivity.
